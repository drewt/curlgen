       ccuurrllggeenn  is  a tool to generate cURL configuration scripts, to automate
       the download of files with cURL.  It reads URLs from standard input and
       generates the script on standard output.

       ccuurrllggeenn supports some features in addition to those offered by cURL, as
       well as supporting all cURL options which can be supplied to configura-
       tion scripts.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       -b, --blacklist
              Specifies  file  types to ignore.  Any URLs which end with a '.'
              followed by an extention given to this option  will  produce  no
              output.

       -d, --base-directory <path>
              Specifies  the  directory  into  which  files will be saved.  If
              --infer is enabled, inferred paths  will  be  relative  to  this
              path. If this option is not given, the current working directory
              is used.

       -e, --extra <list of cURL options>
              Additional cURL options to be produced in the  download  script.
              These  are appended verbatim to the section for each URL.  ccuurrll--
              ggeenn does not check if these are valid options.

       -h, --help
              Usage help.

       -i, --index <index>
              Specifies the index into the path component of the URLs for path
              inference,  for use with the --infer option.  For example, given
              the URL "http://www.example.com/files/docs/example.html',  index
              1  would  return 'files' (index 2, 'docs', etc.) as the inferred
              path.  An index of 0 means that the whole path component  should
              be used (in the previous example, 'files/docs').  By default the
              index is 0.

       --infer
              Infer save paths from URLs.  See the -i, --index option for more
              details.

       --overwrite
              Overwrite files which already exist in the local filesystem.  By
              default curlgen will skip such files.

       -s, --silent
              Silence error messages.

       -v, --verbose
              Generate comments in output.

EEXXAAMMPPLLEESS
       Write script to a file
              curlgen > script.curl
       Pipe script directly to curl
              curlgen | curl --config -
       Save files relative to a given directory, ignoring .html and .rss files
              curlgen -d ~/Downloads -b html rss
       Infer paths, relative to a given directory, from first path component
              curlgen -d ~/Downloads --infer -i 1
