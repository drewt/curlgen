CURLGEN(1)                      curlgen Manual                      CURLGEN(1)



NAME
       curlgen - generate a cURL configuration script

SYNOPSIS
       curlgen [options]

DESCRIPTION
       curlgen  is  a tool to generate cURL configuration scripts, to automate
       the download of files with cURL.  It reads URLs from standard input and
       generates the script on standard output.

       curlgen supports some features in addition to those offered by cURL, as
       well as supporting all cURL options which can be supplied to configura-
       tion scripts.

OPTIONS
       -b, --blacklist
              Specifies  file  types to ignore.  Any URLs which end with a '.'
              followed by an extention given to this option  will  produce  no
              output.

       -d, --base-directory <path>
              Specifies  the  directory  into  which  files will be saved.  If
              --infer is enabled, inferred paths  will  be  relative  to  this
              path. If this option is not given, the current working directory
              is used.

       -e, --extra <list of cURL options>
              Additional cURL options to be produced in the  download  script.
              These  are appended verbatim to the section for each URL.  curl-
              gen does not check if these are valid options.

       -h, --help
              Usage help.

       -i, --index <index>
              Specifies the index into the path component of the URLs for path
              inference,  for use with the --infer option.  For example, given
              the URL "http://www.example.com/files/docs/example.html',  index
              1  would  return 'files' (index 2, 'docs', etc.) as the inferred
              path.  An index of 0 means that the whole path component  should
              be used (in the previous example, 'files/docs').  By default the
              index is 0.

       --infer
              Infer save paths from URLs.  See the -i, --index option for more
              details.

       --overwrite
              Overwrite files which already exist in the local filesystem.  By
              default curlgen will skip such files.

       -s, --silent
              Silence error messages.

       -v, --verbose
              Generate comments in output.

EXAMPLES
       Write script to a file
              curlgen > script.curl
       Pipe script directly to curl
              curlgen | curl --config -
       Save files relative to a given directory, ignoring .html and .rss files
              curlgen -d ~/Downloads -b html rss
       Infer paths, relative to a given directory, from first path component
              curlgen -d ~/Downloads --infer -i 1
